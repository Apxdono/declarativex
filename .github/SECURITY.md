# Yo, Let's Talk Security! 🛡️
## What We're Backing
Hey, here's the deal:

- We're all about giving you the latest minor release with all the bug fixes. 🎉
- When we roll out a new major version, we won't leave you in the dust. We’ll keep the last minor release of the previous major version updated with critical fixes for 6 more months. 🛠️
- Found a security hole in an older version? No worries. If upgrading is a pain and enough peeps are still using that version, we got you. 🛡️

## Spotted a Security Issue? 🚨
Hold up! If you think you've found a security flaw in declarativex, please don’t make it public by dropping an issue on GitHub.

Create a topic in [Security](https://github.com/floydya/declarativex/security/advisories) tab instead. I promise to hit you back ASAP and work on patching that up. 🤝

That's all, folks! Stay secure! 🚀
